# ahk-chickenrace-ishin-script
An AHK script to automate certain sections of the Like a Dragon: Ishin chicken race minigame
## Background
There is a glitch that exists within the chicken racing minigame where if you exit the minigame but at the same time go and start the race, you will start the race without spending any of your tags. One could take advantage of this by betting on all possible outcomes and winning no matter what. The only problem is that we are too slow to bet on all outcomes within the 180 seconds we are given to bet.

This script gets rid of a sizable amount of menial work by automating the betting of the "Quintuple Exacta" and "Triple Exacta" lists, leaving you with only a manageable amount of betting left to do.
## Instructions
1. Install AutoHotKey [here](https://www.autohotkey.com)
2. Download from [here](https://github.com/Spedicus/chickenrace/releases/new), select "Source code (zip)"
3. Extract the contents of the zip file
4. Open the provided script, you should know it's active if you see an "H" in your system tray
5. Open LAD: Ishin and head over to the chicken race minigame
6. In the minigame, go to "Dividend List" and go to the top of the "Quintuple Exacta" list
7. Activate the script by pressing F1 (it is important that your mouse is nowhere near as to not interfere)
8. Enjoy less carpal tunnel syndrome
